# Welcome to Microsoft Teams Clone !!

This is a Microsoft Teams Clone built with WebRTC, ReactJs, Node.js and Chat Engine.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology which allow us to change real time audio and video stream entirely in the browser, as well as allow us to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary.

A library "PeerJS" has been used to handle peer-to-peer connection.
The frontend part is completely implemented using "ReactJS" and material UI for the styling.
The backend part is simply consisted of a "Node.js" server.

Chat Engine is a set of APIs and UI kit specific to chat.

Let's get started and build your own video + chat application!
